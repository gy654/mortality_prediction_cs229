# Mortality prediction using ICD9
This research advances a unique supervised machine learning model that capitalizes on ICD-9 code representations to predict patient mortality rates, leveraging data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) dataset. Our innovative embedding supervised model combines supervised and unsupervised loss functions to enhance the learning of complex relationships between ICD-9 code representations, patient attributes, and mortality risks. The model achieves an AUROC of 82.83\% for 30-day mortality and 83.62\% for 1-year mortality predictionsâ€”substantially surpassing traditional predictive models. Through comparative analysis with algorithms such as XGBoost, Ridge Logistic Regression, and Random Forest, using both the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC) and the Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC) metrics, our approach significantly outperforms benchmark models. The integration of code embeddings with patient demographics in our model not only yields higher predictive accuracy, but also showcases its potential applicability in enhancing clinical decision-making processes. The results of this study underline the ability of our methodology to provide accurate predictions for both short-term and long-term patient mortality, thus offering valuable insights to healthcare professionals.
